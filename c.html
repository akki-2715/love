        <p>I feel so incredibly lucky to have your love. ❤ The moments that make me feel truly alive are your talks, your chats—every little thing about you. Even when I see the number 15, it reminds me of you.</p>
        <p>These days, I find myself thinking about you more and more, blushing uncontrollably every single time. If my face glows or I seem extra active, it’s because I’m thinking of you. You’re my happiness, my light, my everything.</p>
        <p>I promise you that my love for you will never fade. ❤🫂 I’ll make every single moment with you unforgettable, and I’ll always do more than you’ve ever expected of me. I don’t care what anyone says, thinks, or does—I just want you, and I know you will be mine. No one can stop me. Just a little more time, and I’m counting down the days to the moment that will change my life forever.

</p>
        <p>I pray to God, not for money or wealth, but for the blessing of spending more than 21,900 nights with you. You have no idea how much I love you.You have no idea how much I love you. You don’t know how fast my heart races when I see you. You’re my first thought in the morning and my last thought before I sleep.
 My days begin and end with thoughts of you.My love for you is endless. ❤ Countless hugs 🫂 and kisses 💋 await, and there’s so much more I want us to do together.

If I’ve ever hurt you, please let me know, and I promise I’ll never repeat it. My emotions for you are pure love and care.
.❤</p>
        <p><strong>I love you so much, Bhargavi. ❤🫂💋🌍🔐♾</strong></p>
